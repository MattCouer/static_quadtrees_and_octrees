# Static QuadTrees and OcTrees

## Space partitioning structures for [Redot 4.3](https://github.com/Redot-Engine) 2D and 3D

This project includes four generic spatial structures that can be used to divide space in order to streamline positional queries:

*QuadTree: A pointer quadtree for 2D space with extensible cells that can be extended to contain custom data*

*OcTree: A pointer octree for 3D space with extensible cells that can be extended to contain custom data*

*ZQuadTree: A pointerless quadtree for 2D space that use Z order curves for each level of depth*

*ZOcTree: A pointerless octree for 3D space that use Z order curves for each level of depth*
